# React Native Asynchronous State Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where you attempt to access a state variable before it's been fully updated by an asynchronous operation (like a network request).

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows a component that fetches data from an API and attempts to render it immediately. However, because the `fetch` operation is asynchronous, the `data` state variable might still be `null` when the component renders initially, leading to an error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected implementation. It uses conditional rendering to only display the data once it has been successfully fetched and updated in the state.
