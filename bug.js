This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been fully updated by React Native.  This often happens when you're trying to use a value from `useState` or `useReducer` inside a `useEffect` hook before the effect has a chance to run.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  // INCORRECT: data might be null here!
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>  </View>
  );
};
```
